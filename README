This is a basic introduction to scripting using the bash shell language. 
It was given to students in the CAP (Computational Astronomy and Physics)
REU program at UNC-CH during the summer of 2013.

An introduction to Linux/Unix command line usage was given to the
students prior to this tutorial, so knowledge of those basic commands
(eg. ls and pwd) is assumed.

As the focus of the CAP-REU program was computational science,
the examples/motivation given in this tutorial lean toward
that field.
